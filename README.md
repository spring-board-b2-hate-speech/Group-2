<h3>Hate Speech Detection on Twitter platform</h3>
<br>
This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art machine learning model for detecting hate speech in Twitter posts using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a powerful transformer-based model that captures the context of words in a sentence by considering both their left and right context, making it highly effective for natural language processing tasks.
